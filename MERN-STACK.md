## __Getting Started with the MERN Stack:__ ##
#### The [MERN stack](https://alligator.io/react/mern-stack-intro/) is one of the most popular stack of technologies for building a modern single-page app (both frontend and backend). ####
## __Components:__ ##

|  Char |     Semantic                    |
| ------|:------------------------:       |
|   M   |MongoDB as a NoSQL database      |
|   E   |Express web framework of Node.js |
|   R   |React.js                         |
|   N   |Node.js                          |

  1. MongoDB :
        > * An open source document database that provides persistence for application data.
        > * Bridges the gap between key-value stores (fast and scalable) and relational databases (rich functionality).
        > * Stores data as JSON documents in collections with dynamic schemas.
        > * Designed with scalability and developer agility in mind.
        > * Designed to be used asynchronously thus it pairs well with Node.js applications.
  2. Express :

        > * Basically runs the back end code as a module within the Node.js environment.
        > * Handles the routing of requests to the right parts of your app.

  3. React.js :

        > * A JavaScript library developed by Facebook to build interactive / reactive interfaces.

  4. Node.js :

        > * A javascript runtime environment.
        > * An asynchronous event-driven engine - which means the app makes a request for some data and then performs other tasks while waiting for a response.

## MERN VS MEAN STACK ##

> * The single difference is that MERN uses React instead of Angular. React is a highly popular JavaScript library for UI development whereas Angular is a JavaScript Framework for Front-end web development. Thus, discussion on their structures would not be that worth-full. It can be easily said that both implemented in the almost best way possible as there are powerful teams behind of the both React and Angular.

> * Testing : It is crucial and the first string for software development process. There are lots of work already done for testing ReactJS applications, you can use many common tools such Jest, Mocha etc. For testing AngularJS, I guess there is no need to say much. Angular cut out for testing. Even in the official Angular documentations there are lots of testing work. It is not easy to run the risk of losing such a easy-to-test environment to me.
> * Implementation : There is a common HTML-like, hybrid code formatting in ReactJS called as JSX. It can be a very useful property or a waking dream. It is useful when you have an idea and you do not have enough patience to see the result. JSX allow you to implement your idea in a quick way :)
